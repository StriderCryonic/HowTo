# How to implement the basics of docker
### Installing Docker
* The easiest way to install docker onto your device would be to install the Docker Desktop Client. The Docker Desktop Client automatically comes with the Docker Engine, which is the heart of the docker infrastructure.
* Once you follow the installation instructions from the official docker website, you are able to run the "docker" commands in any command prompt / terminal, depending on your system.
* (Note: if you would prefer to use linux commands on windows, you can install the git bash, and run all your commands in there.)

### Basics
* To create a container image, the first step is to create what is known as a "Dockerfile".
* Then you can run a command like: ```docker build --tag <name-of-image>:<version> .``` to finalize and create the image. In this case, the '.' represents the pwd (present working directory)
* To run an image as a container, use the function ```docker run --name <name-of-container> -it <name-of-image>:<version>``` Here, -it can be replaced with -d to run the container 'detached' or 'in the background'

### Volumes

* A Volume is a persistent data storage mechanism used to store data generated by docker containers. This can be used to store data in databases that persist after closing the running container. 
* To create a docker volume, the method is usually running ```docker volume create <volume-name>``` . But we can also leave volume-name blank, allowing docker to generate a random volume name.
* We can mount a docker volume onto a container using the -v tag during initialization.

### Dockerhub

* Dockerhub is an online public repository of docker images that allows one to pull from the repository instead of building their own image. This allows for convenience as well as sharing of images. 
* It is possible to push a docker image to dockerhub by using the function ```docker push <image-name>:<version>``` 
	* Note: if this above snippet is being used, then make sure that the image name is of the format ```<dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<version>``` allowing for the image to be pushed directly to a specific account's repositories.
* It is, conversely, also possible to pull a pushed image from the cloud to use in a project, using ```docker pull <image-name>:<version>```.
	* Note: in all the above cases, if the ```<version>``` is not specified, then the default value is "latest".

### Misc Commands

* Docker Inspect: It is a command that provides detailed information about Docker objects such as containers, images, volumes, networks, tasks and services.
	* By default,it returns information in JSON Format.
	* The command matches any type of object by either ID or name, but it can be restricted to a specific type of object using the --type option.
	* For example: ```docker container inspect <container-name>```
	* ```docker volume inspect <volume-name>```
* Docker History: It is a command that provides version details of a Docker image. This allows one to show all the previous versions of the image as it was updated.
	* ```docker history [options] <image-name>```
